# TAZ5hexagonFanUpgrade
This is an upgrade for the TAZ5 Hexagon hotend 5v fan. We were having issues with PLA heat creep.
This fan duct allows an upgrade to a 40mm cooling fan. We chose a Noctua NF-A4x10 5v 40x10mm cooling fan. This allowed for minimal wiring changes and has performed well on 15 hour plus PLA prints.
It bolts under the carriage via the lefthand M4 hex holding the hotend. You must replace it with a longer M4 25mm hex.
We also added a laser cut finger catcher guard published in a previous repository 40mmOctoFanCovers.Use M3 20mm hex. Countersinks are designed into the print to hold the M3 nuts.
